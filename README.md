# Coding Cafe website template

This repository contains a template website for setting up your own Coding Cafe website. View the appearance of the website [here](https://code-cafes-nl.github.io/website_template/).
The website uses Quarto, which is an open source publishing system that makes it possible to generate html websites from markdown documents. This repository comes with a GitHub actions workflow to automate the rendering of markdown to html, so to update the website you only need to edit markdown files.

## Setup instructions

- In the top right, click 'Use this template'
- Create a repository from this template under your organization or your own user account
- Change the setting for GitHub Pages: Open the repository 'settings', click 'Pages'. For the 'Build and deployment' source select 'GitHub Actions'.
- Now start working on your website!

> [!TIP]
> Clone the repository to your PC and edit files using your favorite code editor, VSCodium, Rstudio, etc. They typically have a 'preview' button that will open the website in a browser to see how your changes will look like.
